# Sales Dashboard

This is an application of a lightweight Sales Dashboard. You can inspect the
details of a lead, convert it to an opportunity and see it on another table.

The application persists on local storage the opportunities made. The default is
an opportunity on the "Won" stage.

A lead can be converted if it's score is above 60, and is not unqualified or converted already. Other business rules are left unchecked since it extends from the assignment.

## Running the application

```
npm run dev
```

OR

```
bun run dev
```

## Assignments

The assignments can be found at `assignments.pdf`
